## Lance Ng -- @daggeraile 

Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm an experience product marketer in the consumer electronics industry. Most people think that marketing is all about creativity and design and all the fluffy things that comes out of our right-brain. But the best marketers have equally powerful left-brains, an analytical mind that helps them make logical decisions and deliver effective marketing strategies. And in that cross-section of Marketing x Data, is where I want to build my career.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for job opportunities in the field of data that leverages on my marketing experience
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a recommender system based on customer purchase history
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the myriad of tools available on the Google Cloud Platform
